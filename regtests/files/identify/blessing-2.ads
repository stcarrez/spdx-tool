--*************************************************************************
--** This header file defines the interface that the SQLite library
--** presents to client programs.  If a C-function, structure, datatype,
--** or constant definition does not appear in this file, then it is
--** not a published API of SQLite, is subject to change without
--** notice, and should not be referenced by programs that use SQLite.
--**
--** Some of the definitions that are in this file are marked as
--** "experimental".  Experimental interfaces are normally new
--** features recently added to SQLite.  We do not anticipate changes
--** to experimental interfaces but reserve to make minor changes if
--** experience from use "in the wild" suggest such changes are prudent.
--**
--** The official C-language API documentation for SQLite is derived
--** from comments in this file.  This file is the authoritative source
--** on how SQLite interfaces are suppose to operate.
--**
--** The name of this file under configuration management is "sqlite.h.in".
--** The makefile makes some minor changes to this file (such as inserting
--** the version number) and changes its name to "sqlite3.h" as
--** part of the build process.
