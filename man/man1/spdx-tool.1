.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIspdx-tool\fR scans the source files to identify licenses and allows to
update them in order to use the SPDX license format.  It can be used to:
.\"
.IP \(bu 4
identify the license used in source files of a project,
.\"
.IP \(bu 4
produce a JSON/XML report for the licenses found with the list of files,
.\"
.IP \(bu 4
replace a license header by the SPDX license tag header.
.\"
.PP
The tool uses the license templates to identify
the license used in source files.  The builtin repository contains arround 600 license templates
and it can be completed by your own templates as long as you use the SPDX license description
format described in
\fIThe Software Package Data Exchange® (SPDX®) Specification Version 2.3\fP.
.\"
.PP
The spdx-tool scans the directory or files passed as parameter.  Directories are scanned recursively
and the
.I .gitignore
file is first looked in each directory to take into account files which are ignored
in the project.  For each file, the spdx-tool tries to:

.\"
.IP \(bu 4
identify the language of the source file,
.\"
.IP \(bu 4
extract the license header text at beginning of the source file,
.\"
.IP \(bu 4
identify the license by using the following algorithms:
.\"
.IP \(bu 6
look for a
.I SPDX-License-Identifier
tag, when it was found, the match report indicates
. IR SPDX ,
.\"
.IP \(bu 6
look for a template match from the license templates
builtin repository or the templates configured for the tool.  When this succeeds, the match
report indicates
.IR TMPL ,
.\"
.IP \(bu 6
guess the best matching license by computing the
.I Tversky
index (0..1) and reporting the repository license having the highest Tversky index.  The report will
indicate the highest Tversky index found.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized by \fIspdx-tool\fR:
.TP 5
-V
Prints the
.I spdx-tool
version.
.TP 5
-v
Enable the verbose mode.
.TP 5
-vv
Enable debugging output.
.TP 5
-t
.I count
Defines the number of threads for the encryption and decryption process.
By default, it uses the number of system CPU cores.
.TP 5
--no-color
Disable colors in output.
.TP 5
--check
Check and gather licenses used in source files.  The report indicates a list of license with their SPDX name,
the number of files found and the overall ratio of files per-license.
.TP 5
--files
Check and gather licenses used in source files.  The report indicates the list of files grouped by the
license SPDX name.
.TP 5
--languages
Produce a report with the list of files grouped by the language identified.  It can be used to identify
and understand why some files have no license header.
.TP 5
--mimes
Produce a report with the list of files grouped by the mime type that is identified.  This option is
useful to understand why some files have no license header.
